This is an analysis file  after running 10 nodes 

The number of messages totally recieved is dependen on which process decided to multicast to that node. On an average around 300-500  messages are getti ng recieved per node

Also, as soon as the 10 nodes send their 100 messages, termination signal is sent to the controller and controller , after aggregating all the termination signal, tell processes to stop. Because of this  some messages that are recieved are not processed.

 Average latency looks fairly accurate for such a system. Latency  time starts with the time  message was generated , random propogation delay introduced, buffer at that part, when queue processor processes it and the actual time when the message gets delivered or consumed at the node.
A standard deviation of the range 100 to 300 is seen, showing the introduced difference in delay and processing is proportional to the delay it recieved randomly as propogation delay. 

Maximum buffer size of the range of 100-200 is seen, as potentially 900 messages , are being sent from 9 nodes to each node. 

Ont the other hand out of the recieved messsages, around 300 messages are seen to be directly delivered without buffering

Broadcast:

Directly Delivered : 50

For broadcast we can see that many more messages are recieved as also the maximum number of messages getting buffered are very high due to highly concurrrent nature of the broadcast application. Also, less number of messages are directly delivered due to the same. 

Average latency is low because there is not much processing of the random selection of nodes , also the low standard deviation abides by this behaviour. 

In broadcast since only single vector matrix are used, processing of each nodes is much faster as compared to the 2d vectors for causally ordered delivery for multicast
